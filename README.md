## Online Farming Vs. Offline Farming

### Online Farming:
Ideal for harvesting Wing Essence and Synthetic Stone materials. Optimize your efficiency by farming the highest stage where you can consistently achieve 1500 kills per minute.

### Offline Farming:
This becomes worthwhile after a significant damage upgrade. It is recommended to engage in 8-16 hours of offline farming to efficiently acquire the next set of traits. Staying longer than 8 hours is not advised; prioritize online farming if possible.

## Altar Progress

- Prioritize leveling one equipment(Atk/HP) level 25 rather than evenly distributing levels across all equipment.
- Every 5 levels of the altar yield a substantial damage boost.

## Pet Stats for Awakening Dungeon and Boss

- Might HP: 6
- Might Attack Power: 5
- Might Attack Speed: 5
- Might Damage Increase: 5
- Might Boss Damage Increase: 5
- Might Buff/Active Skill Crit Damage: 5

## Wing Progress

- Level all wings equally until level 7. (Will provide an update with prioritized wings for level 8 later)

## Hyper/Ultra Wing Stats to Prioritize

- HP, Attack Power, Attack Speed, Damage Increase, Critical Damage, Buff/Active Crit Damage, Boss Damage, Skill Damage

## Thoughts on Normal Monster Damage Stat

- Not essential since farming occurs in the lower stages where monsters are always one-shotted.
- Only worthwhile to include normal damage on equipment options.

## Equipment Stats

### Boss:
- Crit Chance
- Damage Increase
- Damage to Boss
- ATK
- HP

### Online Farming:
- Damage
- ATK
- HP
- Damage to Normal
- Movement Speed
