# Buff Build Experiences in Pixel Hunter

## Online Farming Vs. Offline Farming

### Online Farming:
Best for farming Wing Essence and Synthetic Stone materials. Farm the highest stage where you can consistently get 1500 kills per minute.

### Offline Farming:
Worth it after getting a big damage upgrade. Best to do for 8-16 hours max of offline farming to get the next traits efficiently. I don’t recommend staying longer than 8 hours. Prioritize Online farming if you can.

## Altar Progress

- Prioritize leveling 1 equipment to level 25 instead of leveling all equipment equally.
- Every 5 levels of the altar provides an insane damage boost.
- I’m prioritizing dagger as a buff build. With the right skill build for pushing regular mobs, HP is not an issue for me at Endless 3-18.

## Pet stats for Awakening dungeon and Boss

- Might HP: 6
- Might Attack Power: 5
- Might Attack Speed: 5
- Might Damage Increase: 5
- Might Boss Damage Increase: 5
- Might Buff/Active Skill Crit Damage: 5

## Wing Progress

- Level all wings equally until 7. (Will update with prioritized wings for level 8 later)

## Hyper/Ultra Wing Stats to Prioritize

- HP, Attack Power, Attack Speed, Damage Increase, Critical Damage, Buff/Active Crit Damage, Boss Damage, Skill Damage

## Thoughts on Normal Monster Damage stat

- Not needed since farming happens in the lower stages where monsters will always be one-shotted.
- Only worth it to put normal damage on equipment options.

## Equipment stats

### Boss:
- Crit Chance
- Damage Increase
- DMG to boss
- ATK
- HP

### Online Farming:
- Damage
- ATK
- HP
- DMG to normal
- Movement Speed
